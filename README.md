## Description

This plugin generates a powerful and memorable password. For example, animals, country names, foods etc.

By default WordPress generates a very strong password. But I feel like something is just not there.

This is a spice of password.

1. Upload the memorable-password directory to the plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. When you add a user, memorable passwords are generated.
